Chase channeled guitar greats while crafting songs on the spot based on his musical charter's interaction with the audience. Even with the impromptu compositions the 6 guitar greats transition into a conclusion of the show that was remarkably poetic and inspirational. I can imagine John Lennon looking down and smiling. Chase Padgett, your musical talent and story telling genius makes you a guitar/performance hero. Bravo.",
